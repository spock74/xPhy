# Architecture Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, focusing on the relationships and information flow between key components. It is designed to be informative for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 1. Introduction

This section introduces the system and its main goals.

[//]: # (TODO: Add a brief introduction to the system and its purpose. For example: "This system is designed to [achieve this goal] by [using these technologies].")

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. Component Diagram

This diagram illustrates the main components of the system and their relationships. This provides a high-level view of the system's building blocks.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] --> B(UI Component);
    B --> C{Code Artifact};
    C --> D[Database];
    D --> C;
    C --> E((External API));
    E --> C;
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#cff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#fcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px


Description:

= User: Represents the end-user interacting with the system. This is the person who benefits from the system.
= UI Component: Represents the user interface components (e.g., buttons, forms, displays). This is what the user sees and interacts with.
= Code Artifact: Represents the code modules, classes, or functions that implement the system's logic. This is the engine that drives the system.
= Database: Represents the data storage. This is where the system's information is stored.
= External API: Represents any external services or APIs that the system relies on. This allows the system to connect with other services.


**Item 4: System Architecture - Data Flow Diagram**

```markdown
### 2.2. Data Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the flow of data between the components. Understanding this flow is crucial for identifying potential bottlenecks and ensuring data integrity.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Action] --> B(UI Event);
    B --> C{Code Handler};
    C --> D[Data Processing];
    D --> E(Database);
    E --> F{Data Retrieval};
    F --> C;
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#cff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#fcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px


Description:

- User Action: Represents an action performed by the user (e.g., clicking a button, submitting a form).
- UI Event: Represents the event triggered by the user action.
- Code Handler: Represents the code that handles the event and initiates data processing.
- Data Processing: Represents the data processing logic (e.g., validation, transformation).
- Database: Represents the data storage.
- Data Retrieval: Represents the process of retrieving data from the database.


**Item 5: System Architecture - Code Execution Flow**

```markdown
### 2.3. Code Execution Flow

This diagram illustrates the flow of code execution between different modules. This is a simplified view of how the code works behind the scenes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant Code
    participant Database

    User->>UI: Performs an action
    UI->>Code: Triggers a function call
    Code->>Code: Processes data
    Code->>Database: Queries data
    Database-->>Code: Returns data
    Code->>UI: Updates the UI
    UI->>User: Displays the result


Description:

- User: Initiates the process by performing an action.
- UI: Handles user interactions and displays results.
- Code: Processes data and interacts with the database.
- Database: Stores and retrieves data.


**Item 6: UI/Code Interaction**

```markdown
## 3. UI/Code Interaction

This section describes how the UI components interact with the underlying code.

[//]: # (TODO: Add details about the UI/Code interaction. For example: "The UI components communicate with the code through [specific methods or APIs]. When the user clicks the [button name] button, the [function name] function is called.")

Item 7: User Action and Code Execution

## 4. User Action and Code Execution

This section explains how user actions trigger code execution and data flow.

[//]: # (TODO: Add details about the User Action and Code Execution. For example: "When the user submits the [form name] form, the following steps occur: [step 1], [step 2], [step 3].")

**Item 8: Future Enhancements**

## 5. Future Considerations

This section outlines potential future improvements and expansions.

[//]: # (TODO: Add any future considerations. For example: "In the future, we plan to [add this feature] to [improve this aspect of the system]. We also plan to [integrate with this external service] to [achieve this goal].")
